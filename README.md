As the designated Data Analyst for the project, I conducted a comprehensive range of tasks. These included gathering data from diverse sources, conducting exploratory data analysis, performing data wrangling and preparation, executing statistical analysis and data mining, crafting visual representations through charts and plots, and constructing an interactive dashboard utilizing IBM Cognos Analytics.

The primary focus of the analysis was to pinpoint future skill requirements, identify top programming languages, assess the demand for database skills, and determine the popularity of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

Upon project completion, I compiled a presentation featuring a data analysis report. The report included an executive summary tailored for various stakeholders within the organization, such as Human Resources and the IT Head.
